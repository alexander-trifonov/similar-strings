## Solved problems:
1. Reading large files fast
  - Multithread implementation
  - Singlethread implementation (faster)
2. Levenstein Distance with limited memory usage (x10 of file size)
  - Matrix using implementation (fast, low memory usage)  
  - Recursive implementation (very slow, lower memory usage)
